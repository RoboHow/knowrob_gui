===========

Graphical editor components for KnowRob representations

You will need to set the environment variables LD_PRELOAD and SWI_HOME_DIR before starting 
the editor. You can run the program with the following commands (example values for Ubuntu 
12.04, need to be adapted to your setup):
$ export SWI_HOME_DIR=/usr/lib/swi-prolog
$ LD_PRELOAD=libswipl.so ./KnowRobGUI
